      question: "What is the profit split?",
      answer:
        "Quber Funded split is structured based on performance. Traders keep a significant percentage of generated profits, with higher scaling tiers unlocking improved payout ratios over time.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are there any hidden fees?",
      answer:
        "No hidden charges. The only upfront cost is your selected funded plan. There are no recurring platform fees or surprise deductions beyond standard trading complexities.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I hold positions overnight and over weekends?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Swing trading and holding positions overnight is permitted, provided all risk parameters and maximum drawdown limits are respected.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I breach the rules?",
      answer:
        "If your account violates the defined risk limits, it will be closed in line with our policy. You may reapply for a new funded account at any time. (Since you don't want heavy challenge for language, I softened it to rule breach.)",
    },
    {
      question: "What instruments can I trade?",
      answer:
        "Funded traders can access a wide range of instruments including Forex pairs, indices, commodities, and selected crypto markets, depending on the account tier.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do payouts work?",
      answer:
        "Profits can be withdrawn based on the payout schedule outlined in your funded plan. Once eligibility criteria are met, withdrawals are processed promptly.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a maximum position size?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Position sizing limits are defined to maintain structured risk management. Maximum lot exposure depends on your funded account size.",
